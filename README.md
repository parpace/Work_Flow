# Work_Flow

## Goals and Methods
The goal Work_Flow is to create a project management tool that allows users to organize projects and tasks for themselves, or on a callaborative team. Not too dissimiliar from the widely used "Trello" application.

* This project will be designed using React, Python and Django.
* Users will be able to create a profile to get started.
* When they login, they will be taken to their user home page. Here, they will see a list of all of their current projects, as well as any projects that they have been invited to colaborate on. They will be able to click on a project to visit the page for that project, or create a new project.
